# Codeforces UI Enhancer

Transform the dated Codeforces interface into a modern, minimalistic masterpiece with our Chrome extension.

## The Problem

Codeforces, while being an excellent competitive programming platform, suffers from several UI/UX issues that affect user experience:

1. **Outdated Design:** The current interface feels stuck in the early 2000s, with cluttered layouts and inconsistent styling.
2. **Poor Readability:** Small font sizes, inadequate spacing, and low contrast make content hard to read.
3. **Inconsistent Navigation:** The menu structure is confusing and lacks modern navigation patterns.
4. **Limited Code Editor:** The basic textarea for code submission lacks modern IDE features.
5. **No Dark Mode:** Extended coding sessions can strain eyes without dark mode support.
6. **Unresponsive Design:** The layout breaks on different screen sizes.
